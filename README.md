# Project Euler Problems in Rust

This repository contains solutions to a few Project Euler problems implemented in Rust programming language. The solutions are organized in separate files, one for each problem.

One of the features of this repository is the dynamic compiling of the solutions. All you need to do is to input the problem number when executing the main.rs file and the corresponding solution will be dynamically loaded, compiled and run.

## Rust Version

The Rust version used in this project is 1.68.2.

Feel free to check out the solutions and use them as a reference or starting point for your own Project Euler journey in Rust!
